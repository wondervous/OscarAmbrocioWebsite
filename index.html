        <h2>ðŸ¤“ School + activities</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Oscar. I graduated from Stanford with honors. While there I was involved in a couple of activities. 1) The Haas Center for Public Service; specifically, I was involved in one of their fellowships my freshman year and the Alternative Spring Breaks Program for all four years. 
            2) I worked at the Stanford Alumni Association (SAA). I helped put on events for First-generation and/or Low-income alumni/undergrads and supported the SAA office. 
            3) I was an RA in Wilbur my senior year. I've won multiple awards as an undergrad and even as an ative alum. 4) I was a part of the true gentlemen community (iykyk). I'm also on an advisory board for Stanford.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ’¼ Professional Background </h2>
        <p>I joined a fellowship called VFA. I worked as a Chief of Staff at a cybersecurity startup in the backup and recovery software space. I returned to silicon Valley to work for the former chief scientist at Salesforce to work on AI search. I worked there for a couple years helping the team grow, raise ~$30M and acquired 1 company. I'm proud to say I am one of the few people in the world that worked at a new search engine (non-Google/Bing). 
            I left to work on a space I was passionate about since college--social memory. I started a consumer social company that spread to 60 cities. I also advise startups and nonprofits on product development and fundraising.</p>
        <p>Oh, I also built this website myself using HTML / CSS. </p>
